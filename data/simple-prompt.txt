Return ONLY one line: shouldAnalyze=true or shouldAnalyze=false

shouldAnalyze=true only if ALL are true:
A) .NET backend is primary (C#/.NET/ASP.NET Core as main stack)
B) Distributed/microservices signal exists (microservices OR distributed systems OR Kubernetes/OpenShift/containers at scale OR Kafka/RabbitMQ/Service Bus OR “event-driven” OR “high-scale/multi-tenant” backend)
C) Not junior-only (Senior/Lead/5+ yrs/architecture/ownership OR clearly senior responsibilities)

Reject (shouldAnalyze=false) if:
- frontend-only, mobile-only, or desktop-only
- .NET is only “nice to have” and another stack is primary
- internship/graduate/junior-only
