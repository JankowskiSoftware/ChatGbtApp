EXPERIENCE HIGHLIGHTS (DISTRIBUTED .NET BACKEND)
Relativity (Remote) — .NET Technical Lead (AI Systems) | Sep 2025 – Nov 2025

* Worked on a global-scale platform on a large Azure Kubernetes fleet; backend services in .NET
* Built production observability (Prometheus/Grafana/New Relic), surfaced availability and latency issues
* Investigated multi-layer distributed crashes across microservices and Kubernetes internals; narrowed root-cause domains

Citi / RE Partners (Remote) — Senior Software Developer | Jan 2023 – May 2025

* Built/operated a distributed platform of hundreds of microservices on Kubernetes/OpenShift
* Implemented scalable stream/data processing with Kafka; improved reliability and data integrity checks
* Platform troubleshooting and reliability work using Grafana/Prometheus/Splunk; improved environment stability and developer productivity
* Optimized Redis performance and operational jobs to prevent data-limit failures and improve throughput

Earlier .NET delivery and leadership (selected)

* Verizon (Remote) — C#/.NET Core: architecture improvements, testing adoption, maintainability focus
* Volvo (Wroclaw) — Lead Engineer: greenfield .NET solution, architecture, CI/CD, cross-functional delivery
* The Money Shop UK (Nottingham) — .NET services + SQL: CI/CD adoption, mentoring, delivery optimization
* Incom (Wroclaw) — SQL/T-SQL: TB-scale data processing and performance optimization

MATCH ME WITH
Senior/Lead Backend Engineer, .NET Backend Engineer, Microservices Engineer, Distributed Systems Engineer, Platform Engineer (backend), Cloud Backend Engineer, SRE-adjacent backend roles in C#/.NET, Kubernetes-based environments.
